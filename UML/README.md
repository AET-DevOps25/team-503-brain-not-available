# Usage of UML Diagrams

1. Install the [Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) plugin in Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a new diagram by creating a file with the `.drawio` extension.
3. Open and edit the `.drawio` file using the Draw.io editor integrated into VS Code.
4. Save your changes to preserve the updated diagram.

For more information on using Draw.io, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.diagrams.net/doc/).
